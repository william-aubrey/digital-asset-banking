**User:**

> We have just reached a milestone this morning.  Our main.py runs successfully.  It uploads our file and enters records into our database.  Where would you recommend we go from here?

**Gemini:**

That's fantastic news! Reaching the point where the core end-to-end functionality works is a huge milestone in any project. Congratulations!

Now that you have a working foundation, you're in a great position to build upon it. Based on your `main.py` file, here are my recommendations for where to go from here, categorized into several key areas of software development.

### 1. Code Structure and Maintainability

Your `main.py` currently handles UI, data logic, and S3/Snowflake interactions all in one file. As the app grows, separating these concerns will make it much easier to manage and debug.

**Recommendation:** Refactor your application into a multi-page app with a dedicated library for core logic.

*   **Why?** This is the standard and most scalable way to build Streamlit apps. It cleans up your main script, prevents code duplication, and makes the user navigation intuitive.
*   **How?**
    1.  Create a `pages/` directory.
    2.  Move the UI code for each "page" (Marketplace, Upload, Purchase) from your `if/elif` block into its own Python file inside `pages/`.
    3.  Move the business logic (`upload_asset`, `purchase_asset`, `_get_or_create_sk`, etc.) and configuration setup (S3/Snowflake clients) into a new `lib.py` file.
    4.  Your `main.py` becomes a simple, clean landing page.

### 2. User Experience (UX)

The current interface is functional, but you can make it much more engaging and informative for the user.

*   **Richer Marketplace View:** Instead of `st.dataframe`, consider iterating through the DataFrame rows and using `st.columns` to create a card-based layout for each asset, showing a thumbnail, the name, and a "Purchase" button.
*   **User-Friendly Feedback:** The `st.spinner` is good. You can enhance it by providing more specific messages. After a successful upload, instead of just showing the JSON, you could display the image (if it's an image type) or provide a direct download link from S3.
*   **Session Management:** Currently, the "user" is hardcoded (`'default_uploader'`, `'test_user'`). A great next step is to use `st.session_state` to simulate a user login. You could have a simple text input on the sidebar where a user enters their ID, which is then stored in `st.session_state` and used for all subsequent operations.

### 3. Robustness and Error Handling

You have a great start with `try/except` blocks and database transactions. You can build on this.

*   **User-Facing Errors:** When an exception occurs, like a `ClientError` from S3, consider showing a more user-friendly message than the raw error code. For example: "Upload failed. Please check your file and network connection. If the problem persists, contact support."
*   **Orphaned Files:** What happens if the S3 upload succeeds but the Snowflake transaction fails? You'll have a file in S3 that's not tracked in your database. While your current transaction logic correctly prevents bad data in Snowflake, you might consider adding a periodic cleanup script to find and remove these "orphaned" S3 objects.

### 4. Testing

To ensure your app remains stable as you add features, formalizing your testing is crucial.

*   **Unit Tests:** The functions you'll move into `lib.py` are perfect candidates for unit testing with `pytest`. You can use `unittest.mock` to "mock" the S3 and Snowflake clients so you can test your logic without needing real connections.
*   **UI/App Tests:** You can use Streamlit's built-in `AppTest` framework to write automated tests that simulate user interactions. For example:
    *   An `AppTest` that uploads a file and asserts that a success message appears.
    *   An `AppTest` that navigates to the marketplace and verifies the new asset is listed.

### Concrete Next Step: Refactoring to a Multi-Page App

To get you started, here is a complete set of changes to transform your current application into a more structured, multi-page app.

I'll create a `lib.py` for your core logic, a `pages` directory for your different views, and simplify your `main.py`.

**1. Create `lib.py` for Core Logic**
This file will hold all your non-UI code, making it reusable across pages.
