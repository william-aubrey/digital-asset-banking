# 2025-08-06-0754 Managing Chats

**User:**

> Hi Gemini, what control do i have over managing our list of chats? It seems that every new message becomes a "copy of copy of copy ... original chat". I've tried preceding new chats with a datetime stamp so i can see it in the selection dropdown. Is there another place that i can manage chats?

> Also, does lag increase with the length of the chat?

**Gemini:**

Hello! That's a great question, and it touches on a common challenge when building more complex applications in Streamlit. The behavior you're describing with chat names like "copy of copy of..." and concerns about lag are typical hurdles as a chat app grows.

Let's break down what's likely happening and how you can gain more control over both chat management and performance.

### 1. How to Manage Your List of Chats

The "copy of copy of..." issue suggests that your application's logic for creating new chats might be duplicating an existing chat session without giving it a distinct, new identity. Streamlit provides the building blocks for chat (`st.chat_input`, `st.chat_message`), but the responsibility for managing chat history and sessions lies with the application developer.

The best place to manage this is within your application's UI, typically in a sidebar, by using Streamlit's session state (`st.session_state`) to keep track of all your chats.

Here is a robust pattern for managing chat sessions in Streamlit. This example demonstrates how to create, select, and delete chats from a sidebar.

#### Example: A Chat Management System

You can use this code as a template for your application. It creates a management interface in the sidebar.

```python
import streamlit as st
import time
from datetime import datetime

# Set page config for a better layout
st.set_page_config(page_title="Chat Management Demo", layout="wide")

# --- Session State Initialization ---
# 'st.session_state' is a dictionary-like object that persists across reruns.
# We use it to store our application's state.

# 'chats' will be a dictionary where keys are chat IDs (timestamps) and
# values are dictionaries containing the chat's name and messages.
if "chats" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.chats = {}

# 'current_chat_id' will store the ID of the chat currently being displayed.
if "current_chat_id" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.current_chat_id = None

# --- Helper Functions ---
def create_new_chat():
    """Creates a new chat session and sets it as the current chat."""
    chat_id = time.time()
    # Use a human-readable timestamp for the default name
    chat_name = datetime.fromtimestamp(chat_id).strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    st.session_state.chats[chat_id] = {
        "name": f"Chat - {chat_name}",
        "messages": []
    }
    st.session_state.current_chat_id = chat_id
    st.rerun()

def delete_current_chat():
    """Deletes the currently selected chat."""
    if st.session_state.current_chat_id:
        chat_to_delete = st.session_state.current_chat_id
        del st.session_state.chats[chat_to_delete]
        
        # Select the most recent chat or none if no chats are left
        if st.session_state.chats:
            st.session_state.current_chat_id = max(st.session_state.chats.keys())
        else:
            st.session_state.current_chat_id = None
        st.rerun()

# --- Sidebar for Chat Management ---
with st.sidebar:
    st.header("Chat Management")

    if st.button("‚ûï New Chat", use_container_width=True):
        create_new_chat()

    chat_options = list(st.session_state.chats.keys())
    
    # Sort chats by timestamp descending (most recent first)
    chat_options.sort(reverse=True)

    if chat_options:
        # The selectbox displays chat names but returns the chat_id
        selected_chat_id = st.selectbox(
            "Select a chat",
            options=chat_options,
            format_func=lambda chat_id: st.session_state.chats[chat_id]["name"],
            index=chat_options.index(st.session_state.current_chat_id) if st.session_state.current_chat_id in chat_options else 0
        )

        # Update the current chat if the selection changes
        if selected_chat_id != st.session_state.current_chat_id:
            st.session_state.current_chat_id = selected_chat_id
            st.rerun()

        if st.button("üóëÔ∏è Delete Current Chat", use_container_width=True, type="secondary"):
            delete_current_chat()
    else:
        st.write("No chats yet. Start a new one!")


# --- Main Chat Interface ---
if st.session_state.current_chat_id:
    current_chat = st.session_state.chats[st.session_state.current_chat_id]
    st.header(current_chat["name"])

    # Display chat messages from history
    for message in current_chat["messages"]:
        with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
            st.markdown(message["content"])

    # Accept user input
    if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
        # Add user message to chat history
        current_chat["messages"].append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
        with st.chat_message("user"):
            st.markdown(prompt)

        # Display assistant response
        with st.chat_message("assistant"):
            # Simulate a streaming response
            response = f"Echo from '{current_chat['name']}': {prompt}"
            st.write(response)
        
        # Add assistant response to chat history
        current_chat["messages"].append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
else:
    st.info("Create a new chat or select an existing one from the sidebar to begin.")

```

This approach gives you a dedicated place in the sidebar to manage your chats, solving the core problem you described.

### 2. Does Lag Increase with Chat Length?

**Yes, absolutely.** Your intuition is correct. Lag will increase as a chat conversation gets longer.

Here‚Äôs why:

1.  **Streamlit's Execution Model:** Every time you send a message or interact with a widget, Streamlit reruns your entire script from top to bottom.
2.  **Re-rendering the History:** In a typical chat app, your script iterates through the entire list of messages stored in `st.session_state` and uses `st.chat_message` to display each one on every rerun.
3.  **Increased Payload:** As the message history grows, the amount of data that needs to be processed by Python and sent from the Streamlit server to your web browser increases.
4.  **DOM Size:** A very long chat history results in a very large number of HTML elements (the DOM) in the browser. This can make the browser itself slow and less responsive, as it has more to render and manage.

#### How to Mitigate Performance Issues

Here are a few strategies to keep your chat application performant, from simple to more advanced:

1.  **Truncate the Displayed History:** The simplest solution is to only display the most recent `N` messages. You still keep the full history in `st.session_state`, but you only render a portion of it.

    ```python
    # Inside your main chat interface
    MAX_MESSAGES_TO_DISPLAY = 50
    messages_to_display = current_chat["messages"][-MAX_MESSAGES_TO_DISPLAY:]

    for message in messages_to_display:
        with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
            st.markdown(message["content"])
    ```

2.  **Summarize Older Parts of the Conversation:** For very long-running chats, you can use an LLM to periodically summarize the conversation up to a certain point. You would then store this summary and discard the older, detailed messages from the active `session_state`. This keeps the context for the LLM without the performance overhead of storing every single message.

3.  **Persist Chats to a Database or Files:** For a more permanent and scalable solution, you can save and load chat sessions from a database (like SQLite, PostgreSQL) or flat files (like JSON or Pickle files). In this model:
    *   `st.session_state` would only hold the *currently active* chat.
    *   The sidebar would list chats by querying the database or scanning a directory.
    *   Selecting a chat would load its history from storage into `st.session_state`.
    *   New messages would be appended to the active chat in `session_state` and also saved back to the database/file.

I hope this gives you a clearer picture and some actionable strategies for improving your chat application. Let me know if you have any more questions!
