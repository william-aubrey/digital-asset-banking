# [Session Title: A short, descriptive title of the session's main theme]

## Executive Summary

*(A brief, one-paragraph summary of the session's objective, key activities, and the final outcome. This should be clear enough for someone to understand the session's value without reading the full narrative.)*

---

## 1. The Challenge / The Goal

*(Describe the initial state or the problem we set out to solve. What was the core question or task? What were the known constraints or hurdles?)*

## 2. The Collaborative Journey

*(This is the main narrative. Recount the step-by-step process of our collaboration. This can be structured with sub-headings. Highlight key moments, decisions, and breakthroughs.)*

### Key Decision 1: [Name of Decision]
*(Explain a critical choice we made.)*

### Breakthrough: [Name of Breakthrough]
*(Describe a moment of key insight or when a major blocker was resolved. Include relevant code snippets or diagrams here if applicable.)*

```python
# Example code snippet
print("Hello, World!")
```

## 3. Key Outcomes & Learnings

*(Summarize the tangible results of the session. What was created or fixed? What were the main conceptual or technical lessons learned?)*

*   **Outcome 1:** [e.g., Successfully connected the application to Snowflake.]
*   **Learning 1:** [e.g., Understood the difference between IDE workspace context and AI prompt context.]
