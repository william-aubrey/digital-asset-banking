We will perform a function by function comparison between the model described in **A1-manage-asset-lifecycle.md**  and the python functions written in **A1-manage-asset-lifecycle.py** .

Please produce the comparison in a side by side table showing the model and python functions aligned side-by-side.  Provide a brief description of the function.

For any orphaned functions, please list in the table and describe why the misalignment may have occurred?
Of course. Here is a function-by-function comparison between the IDEF0 model in `A1-manage-asset-lifecycle.md` and the implementation in `A1-manage-asset-lifecycle.py`.

### Direct Functional Comparison

The following table shows a strong, direct alignment between the functions defined in the IDEF0 model and their corresponding implementations in the Python script.

| Model Node & Name | Model Description | Python Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A1.1: Display Asset Marketplace** | Queries the data warehouse to present a view of available assets to the user. | The Streamlit code block under `if choice == "Asset Marketplace (Snowflake)":` which queries the `DIM_ASSETS` table and displays the results in a dataframe. |
| **A1.2: Process New Asset Upload** | Handles the validation, S3 upload, and database metadata registration for a new asset. | The `upload_asset(...)` function, which orchestrates the entire upload process, including S3 interaction and Snowflake transactions. |
| **A1.3: Execute Asset Purchase** | Updates asset ownership and records the transaction in the database. | The `purchase_asset(...)` function, which executes the ownership change and records the purchase event in the fact table. |
| **A1.2.1: Get or Create Surrogate Key** | A utility function that retrieves an existing surrogate key for a given business key or creates a new one if it doesn't exist. | The `_get_or_create_sk(...)` function, which provides the generic "get or create" logic for dimension table lookups. |

### Analysis of Unmodeled Python Functions (Orphans)

These Python functions and classes exist in the script but are not represented as distinct function boxes in the IDEF0 model. This is not an error, but a correct level of abstraction. They are implementation details of higher-level concepts that *are* present in the model.

| Orphaned Python Function/Class | Reason for Misalignment (Why it is not explicitly modeled) |
| :--- | :--- |
| `_get_or_create_asset_type_sk()` <br> `_get_or_create_user_sk()` | These are specific, typed wrappers around the generic `_get_or_create_sk()` function. The model correctly abstracts this pattern into the single, reusable function `A1.2.1: Get or Create Surrogate Key`. Modeling each specific implementation would add unnecessary complexity. |
| `register_asset_type()` <br> `get_registered_types()` <br> `CYOAPlugin` | These components are the concrete implementation of the **`Asset Type Plugins` mechanism**. In IDEF0, a mechanism is a resource used to perform a function. The model correctly identifies `Asset Type Plugins` as a mechanism for `A1.2: Process New Asset Upload`, rather than modeling its internal helper functions as separate activities. |

In summary, the alignment between the model and the code is excellent. The functions that are not explicitly modeled as boxes are correctly represented as either implementation details of a more abstract function or as part of a mechanism.
