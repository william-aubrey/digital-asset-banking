Please evaluate the naming convention of functions in the **A1-manage-asset-lifecycle.py** file.  Can we update the file so that the functions are prefixed and perhaps named according the IDEF0 model?

These are the key name replacements:
*   A1: Decomposition of "Manage Asset Lifecycle"
    *   A1.1: Display Asset Marketplace (node A11)
    *   A1.2: Process New Asset Upload (node A12))
    *   A1.3: Execute Asset Purchase (node A13))
*   A1.2: Decomposition of "Process New Asset Upload"
    *   A1.2.1: Get or Create Surrogate Key (node A121))

I would expect that the A11 function might be named something like A11-display-asset-marketplace.  Please advise on the extent to which we can apply IDEF0 naming conventions to the python code.



```markdown
*   A1: Decomposition of "Manage Asset Lifecycle"
    *   A1.1: Display Asset Marketplace (node A11)
    *   A1.2: Process New Asset Upload (node A12))
    *   A1.3: Execute Asset Purchase (node A13))
*   A1.2: Decomposition of "Process New Asset Upload"
    *   A1.2.1: Get or Create Surrogate Key (node A121))
```
Excellent question. Aligning the function names in your Python code with the IDEF0 model is a fantastic practice. It creates a "living document" where the code directly reflects the architectural model, making the system significantly easier to understand, maintain, and trace.

We can absolutely apply the IDEF0 naming convention to the Python code. The standard Python convention (PEP8) uses lowercase letters and underscores, so a function like `A1.1: Display Asset Marketplace` would translate well to `a11_display_asset_marketplace`.

### Analysis and Recommendations

1.  **Directly Mapped Functions**: The functions `upload_asset`, `purchase_asset`, and `_get_or_create_sk` have direct counterparts in the IDEF0 model and can be renamed.
2.  **Refactoring for Alignment**: The "Display Asset Marketplace" logic is currently implemented as a block of code inside the main Streamlit `if/elif` structure, not as a distinct Python function. To align with the model, the best approach is to refactor this block into its own function, `a11_display_asset_marketplace`. This improves both model alignment and code modularity.
3.  **Internal Helpers**: Functions like `_get_or_create_asset_type_sk` are specific wrappers around the more generic `_a121_get_or_create_sk`. As they don't have their own node in the model, we will leave their names as-is but update them to call the newly renamed generic function.

Here are the recommended changes to refactor `A1-manage-asset-lifecycle.py` according to the IDEF0 model:

These changes successfully rename the core functions to match the IDEF0 model and refactor the marketplace view into its own model-aligned function, significantly improving the clarity and traceability of your code.
