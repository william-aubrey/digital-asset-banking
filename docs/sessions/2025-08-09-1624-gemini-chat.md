    You are a process designer skilled in IDEF0 decomposition.  We are now entering the phase where we need to build a Snowflake database to house all the IDEF0 A-0 models that we are going to build.  We first need to setup the database and the RBAC.
    
    We will execute on these efforts in a specific sequence.  
    
    First we will build a process decomposition of A2.1: Provision Ontologic Infrastructure which is described in **A2-ontologics.md**.  We will build a decomposition file named a21-provision-ontologic-infrastructure.md 
    
    Second, we develop an agent that will execute this a21 process.  It will be named fhoa-a21-provision-ontologic-infrastructure. It will site in the G:\My Drive\A0 WRA\Digital Assets\Banking\digital-asset-banking\A3_FHOA_Heuristics\agents\fhoa-a21-provision-ontologic-infrastructure folder. The python script will be named fhoa-a21-provision-ontologic-infrastructure.py.
    
    
    Please execution on file and folder creations as needed.  Please provide the text of your response in the form of the complete raw markdown source of my prompt and your response. Format the entire output as a single indented code block by prefixing every line with four spaces. This should prevent the chat window from rendering any markdown within it.
    
    Create a new file located at this file path G:\My Drive\A0 WRA\Digital Assets\Banking\digital-asset-banking\docs\sessions.  The file naming convention is YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-gemini-chat.md. The date is [2025-08-09-1624].
    
    Copy the contents from your output into this file and save the file.

    Of course. As a process designer and coding assistant, I can certainly help you with this next phase of building out the FHOA framework's foundational database layer. Decomposing the provisioning process and then creating the agent to execute it is a perfect application of the FHOA methodology.
    
    Here are the requested files and folder creations.
    
    First, I'll create the IDEF0 decomposition for the `A2.1: Provision Ontologic Infrastructure` process. This model breaks the process down into executing the schema definition language (DDL) and then the role-based access control (RBAC) data control language (DCL).

    +# FHOA Ontologics (A2.1) Process Model: Provision Ontologic Infrastructure
    +
    +This document provides the IDEF0-style decomposition for the **A2.1: Provision Ontologic Infrastructure** function within the FHOA framework. Its primary purpose is to define the steps required to create and secure the database that will store all enterprise process models.
    +
    +---
    +
    +## A2.1: Provision Ontologic Infrastructure (Top-Level Function)
    +
    +- **Purpose**: To create or verify the necessary database schema and access control policies for storing and managing IDEF0 models.
    +- **Inputs**: 
    +  - `IDEF0 Data Model (SQL)`: The DDL script defining the tables and schema.
    +  - `RBAC Policy Definition`: The definition of roles and the permissions they require.
    +- **Controls**: 
    +  - `Database Admin Credentials`: High-privilege credentials required to create databases, roles, and grant permissions.
    +- **Outputs**: 
    +  - `Provisioned Database Schema`: The live database objects in Snowflake.
    +  - `Applied RBAC Policies`: The roles and grants applied to the schema.
    +- **Mechanisms**: 
    +  - `fhoa-a21-provision-ontologic-infrastructure (Agent)`: The automated script that executes the provisioning.
    +  - `Snowflake Connection`: The database connector.
    +
    +---
    +
    +## A2.1 Decomposition: The Provisioning Sequence
    +
    +The A2.1 function is decomposed into two sequential sub-processes.
    +
    +### A2.1.1: Execute Schema DDL
    +
    +- **Purpose**: To create and configure the database, schema, and tables for storing IDEF0 models.
    +- **Inputs**: `IDEF0 Data Model (SQL)`
    +- **Controls**: `Database Admin Credentials`
    +- **Outputs**: `Provisioned Database Schema` (to A2.1.2)
    +- **Mechanisms**: `Provisioning Agent`, `Snowflake Connection`
    +
    +---
    +
    +### A2.1.2: Execute RBAC DCL
    +
    +- **Purpose**: To create roles and grant the necessary permissions for interacting with the IDEF0 database schema.
    +- **Inputs**: 
    +  - `Provisioned Database Schema` (from A2.1.1)
    +  - `RBAC Policy Definition`
    +- **Controls**: `Database Admin Credentials`
    +- **Outputs**: `Applied RBAC Policies`
    +- **Mechanisms**: `Provisioning Agent`, `Snowflake Connection`
    
    ```
    
    Next, I'll create the `manifest.yaml` for the new agent. This file describes the agent and how to run it, corresponding to FHOA processes A3.1 and A3.3.

    +name: "fhoa-a21-provision-ontologic-infrastructure"

    +description: "An agent to provision the FHOA Ontologics database schema and RBAC policies in Snowflake."

    +    description: "Runs the Snowflake provisioning script using environment variables for credentials."
    
    ```
    
    Now, here is the Python script for the agent itself. This script reads the `idef0-data-model.sql` file and executes it, then sets up the necessary roles and permissions in Snowflake. It's designed to be idempotent, so it can be run multiple times safely.
