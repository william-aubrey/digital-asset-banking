## A-0: Manage Digital Asset Banking Platform (Context)

This is the highest-level view, defining the overall scope and boundary of the system.

### ICOMs (Inputs, Controls, Outputs, Mechanisms)

#### Inputs
* `User-Provided Digital Content`: The raw files (images, code, etc.) that are transformed into assets.
* `User Stories & Requirements`: The functional and non-functional requirements that drive development.

#### Controls
* `Regulatory & Compliance Standards`: External rules like GDPR, LGPD, and SOC 2 that the platform must adhere to.
* `Architectural Specifications`: The established designs for the cloud infrastructure, data model, and RBAC policies that govern the implementation.

#### Outputs
* `Managed Digital Assets`: The final digital products, securely stored and tracked.
* `Physical Trading Cards`: A key tangible output of the platform's vision.
* `Transaction Records & Audit Logs`: Data produced to ensure compliance and provide user history.
* `Platform Analytics & Dashboards`: Aggregated data provided to stakeholders like investors.

#### Mechanisms
* `End Users & Platform Administrators`: The human actors who operate and maintain the system.
* `Cloud Infrastructure`: The underlying AWS and Snowflake platforms.
* `CI/CD Pipeline`: The automated system for deploying code and infrastructure changes.

### A2: Administer Platform Resources
*   **Description**: Covers the operational and development activities required to build and maintain the platform.
*   **Inputs**: `User Stories & Requirements`
*   **Controls**: `Regulatory & Compliance Standards`
*   **Outputs**: `Provisioned Cloud Resources`, `Deployed Application`, `Audit Logs`
*   **Mechanisms**: `Platform Administrators`, `Cloud Infrastructure`, `CI/CD Pipeline`

### A3: Provide Analytics & Compliance
*   **Description**: Addresses the needs of stakeholders for insight and oversight.
*   **Inputs**: `Transaction Records` (from A1), `Audit Logs` (from A2)
*   **Controls**: `Regulatory & Compliance Standards`
